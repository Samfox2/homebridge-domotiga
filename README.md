[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-domotiga.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-domotiga)
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/Samfox2/homebridge-domotiga.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/Samfox2/homebridge-domotiga)

Supports [Domotiga](https://domotiga.nl) devices on [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) platform.

The latest version (work in progress) supports following (primary) services:

- ```TemperatureSensor``` (temperature)
- ```HumiditySensor``` (humidity) 
- ```AirQualitySensor``` (air quality) 
- ```FakeEveAirQualitySensor``` (custom Eve service, same as AirQualitySensor with additional ppm value in Eve app)
- ```FakeEveWeatherSensor``` (custom Eve service with airpressure in Eve app)
- ```Contact``` (contact state) 
- ```LeakSensor``` (leaksensor state) 
- ```MotionSensor``` (motionsensor state) 
- ```Switch``` (get/set switch state) 
- ```Outlet``` (get/set outlet state)
- ```Door``` (get/set door position) 
- ```Window``` (get/set window position) 
- ```WindowCovering``` (get/set window covering positon) 
- ```Powermeter``` (power consumption) 

Domotiga device value numbers (e.g. which device value represents temperature) can be assigned directly within the config.json file. 
For multi-sensors (e.g. combined temperature/humidity sensors) additional characteristics can be added by defining their domotiga values in config.json (see example below).
