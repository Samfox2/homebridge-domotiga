# homebridge-domotiga

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-domotiga.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/homebridge-domotiga)
[![Dependency Status](https://gemnasium.com/badges/github.com/Samfox2/homebridge-domotiga.svg)](https://gemnasium.com/github.com/Samfox2/homebridge-domotiga)

Supports [Domotiga](https://domotiga.nl) devices on [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) platform.

The latest version (work in progress) supports following (primary) services:

- ```TemperatureSensor``` (temperature)
- ```HumiditySensor``` (humidity) 
- ```AirQualitySensor``` (air quality) 
- ```FakeEveAirQualitySensor``` (custom Eve service, same as AirQualitySensor with additional ppm value in Eve app)
- ```FakeEveWeatherSensor``` (custom Eve service with airpressure in Eve app)
- ```Contact``` (contact state) 
- ```LeakSensor``` (leaksensor state) 
- ```MotionSensor``` (motionsensor state) 
- ```Switch``` (get/set switch state) 
- ```Outlet``` (get/set outlet state)
- ```Door``` (get/set door position) 
- ```Window``` (get/set window position) 
- ```WindowCovering``` (get/set window covering positon) 
- ```Powermeter``` (custom service with power consumption)

Domotiga device value numbers (e.g. which device value represents temperature) can be assigned directly within the config.json file. 
For multi-sensors (e.g. combined temperature/humidity sensors) additional characteristics can be added by defining their domotiga values in config.json (see example below).

Older version using API 1.0: [homebridge-domotiga-1.0](https://github.com/Samfox2/homebridge-domotiga-1.0) (deprecated)

### Switching from homebridge-domotiga (API 1.0)
Users switching from homebridge-domotiga will need to remove their old config in `config.json` and use the new config. Hence, DomotiGa will show up as brand new device. This is due to the fact that API 2.0 only supports platform plugins and homebridge-domotiga was implemented as an accessory plugin. This means any configurations, alarms, scenes, etc to which the devices were associated will need to be updated with the new DomotiGa devices.

# Installation

1. Install homebridge using:  ```npm install -g homebridge```
2. Install this plugin using: ```npm install -g git+https://github.com/Samfox2/homebridge-domotiga.git``` or ```npm install -g homebridge-domotiga```
3. Update your configuration file. See sample-config.json in this repository for a sample.
